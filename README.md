# Automation tests for the Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe game

I've created automation tests to demonstrate how easy it is to simulate multiple players playing in real-time with the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) framework.


## Test suite

- âœ“  game.spec.js:4:3 â€º Tic Tac Toe â€º Cross should win (2s) 
- âœ“  game.spec.js:27:3 â€º Tic Tac Toe â€º Circle should win (2s)
- âœ“  game.spec.js:51:3 â€º Tic Tac Toe â€º The game should be drawn (1s)

4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies defined in package.json.
5. Run `npx playwright test` to execute tests

# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe Game

I tested here the [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/pranjalibajpai/Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe) developed using Node.js, Express.js and Socket.io by [Pranjali Bajpai](https://github.com/pranjalibajpai) and all credits go to her.

## Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ
